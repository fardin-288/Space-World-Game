# Introduction
Space_Game_Worker_Master is an SDL-based game written in c and c++ language. The simple and clear code made this game exceptional.The written code is easily customizable.Its a game of spaceship which goes in space.The user can control the spaceship.There are asteroids in the space .The user save the spaceship from the clash of asteroids.
# Objectives
1.All the codes written in this project are simple, clean and easy to change .

2.The design of this project is memory efficient and can show the same efficiency in any device.

# Pre-requisites

1.libsdl2-dev

2.libsdl2-image-dev

3.libsdl2-mixer-dev

4.libsdl2-ttf-dev

# Project Modules

1.main.cpp

Calling the Game variable and using its functions init(), running(), handleEvents(), and render() in the main() function for initializing, running loop, handling the events and rendering the objects continuously.

Functio

Provides values.hpp,Initialize.hpp,motion.hpp,High_score.txt

Image folder contains all images like background,spaceship,bullet,asteroid,explosion.

src folder contains all header files.

README.txt contains the command by which you can run the game.

# Game Feature

In the front page of the game there are 3 options these are play,instruction and exit

# Running the game

Use this command in your terminal:

g++ -Isrc/Include -Lsrc/lib -o main main.cpp -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_mixer -lSDL2_ttf

# Limitation

1.All codes are written in c in a structured manner.Object-oriented programming is not used.

2.The almost 95 percent code is written in c language.No upgraded feature  of c++ is available.

# Conclusion

After learning a new programming language the game project is helpful for us to learn project handling ,pressure handling,communication hacks that must be learned by software developers .We hope we can implement these learnings in our other real life projects. 

# Library and Tools

1.C/C++ - Basic coding of the game done in c!

2.VS Code - Free. Built on open-source yet powerful IDE!

3.SDL2 - cross-platform development library designed to provide low-level access!

4.Inkscape - professional quality vector graphics software and open source!

5.Git/GitHub - software development and version control using Git!
